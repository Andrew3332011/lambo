                Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

                Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.
                
                The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.
                
                In 2021, the CEO of Lamborghini said that by 2024 all its models will be hybrid

                <b>Ferruccio Lamborghini</b>(Italian pronunciation: [ferˈruttʃo lamborˈɡiːni]; 28 April 1916 – 20 February 1993) was an Italian automobile designer, inventor, mechanic, engineer, winemaker, industrialist and businessman who created Automobili Lamborghini in 1963, a maker of high-end sports cars in Sant'Agata Bolognese.

                Born to grape farmers in Renazzo, from the comune of Cento in the Emilia-Romagna region, his mechanical know-how led him to enter the business of tractor manufacturing in 1948, when he founded Lamborghini Trattori, which quickly became an important manufacturer of agricultural equipment in the midst of Italy's post-WWII economic boom. In 1959, he opened an oil burner factory, Lamborghini Bruciatori, which later entered the business of producing air conditioning equipment.
                
                Lamborghini founded a fourth company, Lamborghini Oleodinamica, in 1969 after creating Automobili Lamborghini in 1963. Lamborghini sold off many of his interests by the late 1970s and retired to an estate in Umbria, where he pursued winemaking.
                Ferruccio Elio Arturo Lamborghini was born on April 28.1916 under the Zodiac sign of Taurus, his parents were farmers but Ferruccio soon decided he wanted to do something with mechanics. He started working on his father’s tractor out of interest and was able to attend a technical school in Bologna later on.

During the second World War he was enrolled into the Italian Air Force, working for the transport sections, after 1944 he became a prisoner of war in the British military forces who put him to work in their motoring department, this way Ferruccio got firsthand experience keeping cars on the road, even with limited part supplies.

After the war he returned to his hometown and started converting old war surplus material into much needed tractors for the local farmers, the Lamborghini tractor business was inaugurated in a small garage, but the business got really successful and had to move into larger premises soon thereafter.
By now Ferruccio also started tuning Fiat cars; he actually built a Fiat Topolino for himself and entered in the 1948 Mille Miglia competition, unfortunately the car was wrecked in an accident. By 1949 Ferruccio Lamborghini was able to start building tractors from scratch, without using any leftovers, the Lamborghini Trattori factory was founded and production soon grew even further. The Lamborghini tractors became known as the best in Italy and Ferruccio started organizing tractor-pulls in his hometown just to show the superiority of his machines.

The tractor business made him a very wealthy man, and he started another factory building air-conditioning and central heating equipment. This additional enterprise made Ferruccio Lamborghini even more money and soon he became one of the wealthiest men in Italy, his love for fast cars became legendary as Ferruccio owned multiple exotic cars back then, a Mercedes SL300, a Jaguar and a Ferrari among others.

But his personal Ferrari ran into problems with the clutch and Ferruccio, being the hands on person he was, went to visit Enzo Ferrari to complain about it … Enzo refused to meet him as history is told, but that didn’t stop Ferruccio Lamborghini.

                The Lamborghini Huracán (Spanish for "hurricane"; [uɾaˈkan]) is a sports car manufactured by Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini replacing the previous V10 offering, the Gallardo. The Huracán was revealed online in December 2013, making its worldwide debut at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show, and was released in the market in the second quarter of 2014.
                With a curb weight of 1,553 kg (3,424 lb), the Huracán LP 610-4 has a power-to-weight ratio of 2.55 kg (5.62 lb) per horsepower
                The Huracán maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine with an additional 0.2 litres, compared to the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. To increase its efficiency, the Huracán's engine also includes a start-stop system.[citation needed] The firing order of the engine is 1, 6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9. This is printed on a metal plate on the top of the engine, as with all other Lamborghini models.

The drag coefficient of Cd=0.39 was undisclosed until 2021.

                Following the Miura, Islero, Countach and Urraco, today’s most iconic Lamborghini reflects the heritage of the historic S models into the Aventador S. The exclusive design and a V12 engine that develops an extraordinary 740 hp combine with the most sophisticated technology available, LDVA (Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Attiva, Lamborghini Active Vehicle Dynamics).
                The Aventador S expresses unmistakable Lamborghini DNA, adding even more dynamism, refinement and aggressiveness through its finely honed features. The hexagonal design of the new exhaust pipes evoke the power of the space shuttle; the front end is shaped to resemble a shark, conveying the same strength and elegance in dominating its own environment: the road. Each and every surface of the Aventador S is designed for maximum power, taking performance to previously unheard-of levels. 
                The Aventador S is a luxurious super sports car with cutting-edge technology. The interior finishes feature materials of the highest quality and present an infinite variety of possibilities. The elegant design combines with the most advanced features, such as an instrument panel that features an interactive liquid-crystal TFT display with redesigned graphics, and a customizable LED lighting system.
                Listen to the iconic naturally aspirated V12 engine, a throbbing 740 CV heart that unleashes maximum power with a breathtaking soundtrack, reaching speeds of more than 217 mph (350 km/h).
                Every surface of the Aventador S is designed to gain power and to improve performance, with sharp lines inspired by the principles of nature and aeronautics.

                The Lamborghini Egoista is a concept car unveiled by Lamborghini for the company's 50th anniversary. The fully functioning model is based on the Gallardo. It features a 5.2 L (317 cu in) V10 engine producing 600 hp (447 kW; 608 PS).

The Lamborghini Egoista has a unique one-seat cockpit, which is similar to that of a modern fighter jet, and has a canopy door that is completely removable. The steering wheel must be removed to enter and exit the vehicle like a Formula One car.

The unique exterior of the Lamborghini Egoista is meant to resemble a bull ready to charge if looked at from the side. The lighting resembles that of a modern airplane, with sidemarkers and indicators on the sides and top of the car as well as front and rear. The bodywork consists of active aerodynamic panels that raise and lower for optimum downforce and stability. The body and wheels are made of antiradar material to even more identify with fighter jets.

In Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Portuguese, Polish, Romanian, Hungarian, Serbian and French, Egoista literally means "selfish". According to the model's designer Walter de Silva, the Egoista "represents hedonism taken to the extreme".
